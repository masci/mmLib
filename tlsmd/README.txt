TLS Minimized Domains 0.0.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TLS Minimal Domains (TLSMD) is a program which computes optimal 
TLS (rigid-body) descriptions from the isotropically or anisotropically 
refined ADPs of a protein crystal structure.   This is accomplished in a
somewhat brute-force mannor.  First, a single TLS model is fit by least
squares to every possible subsegment of a protein chain and its its 
goodness of fit assessed by the least squares fit residual.  The number of
possible subsegments of a protein depends on its numer of residues, n, and
the minimum segment width, w, is given by the equation below:
