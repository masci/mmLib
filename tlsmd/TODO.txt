TODO items for TLSMD: Jay Painter Aug 2, 2005
---------------------------------------------

* webtlsmdrund.py: Have it send email once a job is complete.

* tlsmdmodule.py: Complete the high-speed C implementation of of TLS model
LSQ Fit / SVD solver.

* Graph Filling:  For some protein chains, there exist regions withing
the chain so disordered that no valid TLS approximation exists.  
These chains lead to disconnected minimization graphs which fail to minimize.
A procedure must be developed for finding disconnected regions, and adding
graph edges to connect the graph.

* Use Experimental Sigmas from PDB File: Its very rare, but some structures
do have sigmas for the ADPs.  It would be interesting to use them in the 
LSQR fits instead of the 1/Uiso assumption.

* Output structure displacement files suitable for use as input files
to Dock/Autodock.

* Non-rigid regions (flexible linkers): Add flexible regions to the graph before
minimization.  The flexible protein segments can be determined by inspection
of the TLS tensors for the segment from the TLS database generated by the first
stage of the minimization.  The challenge is to add them to the graph with
reasonable weights.  With the valid TLS segments, the weight of each segment is
the LSQR residual of the TLS model vs. refined ADPs.  Segments with better fits
have lower cost (weight).  For segments which are determined to be flexible, a cost must be calculated such that the most flexible segments have the lowest cost, and the cost of those segments must be on the same scale as the cost of the best fitting rigid TLS segments. 

* TLS displacement calculations with restraints.  The TLS displaced structures
(predicted structures) should have proper stereochemistry and packing.  This
can be performed by energy minimization with selected terms.  See the method 
used by MoveDB to generate morphs using multiple conformations(Krebs & Gerstein).
