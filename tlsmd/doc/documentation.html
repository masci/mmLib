<center><h3>Introduction</h3></center>
<!-- BLOCK: INDEX -->
<p><font size=+1><b>TLSMD</b></font>
analyzes a protein crystal structure for evidence of flexibility, in the form
of local or inter-domain motions.  It does this by partitioning the protein structure into multiple segments which are modeled as rigid bodies undergoing TLS (Translation/Libration/Screw) vibrational motion. It generates all possible segmentations up to a specified maximum number of TLS groups. Each trial segmentation is evaluated by comparison to the observed atomic displacement parameters (ADPs, "thermal parameters") that came out of crystallographic refinement.
</p>

<p><font size=+1><b>TLSMD</b></font>
generates the optimal 1-group TLS model, the optimal 2-group TLS model, and so
on up to a default of 20 TLS groups total.
For each such model you get statistics describing how well this model accounts
for the thermal motion observed in the crystal structure.
</p>

<p><font size=+1><b>More Information </b></font>
about TLS groups can be found in the
<a href="http://pymmlib.sourceforge.net/doc/tlsview/tlsview.html">TLSView Manual</a>.
It covers interpretation of the TLS parameters, and  the structure visualizations
generated by the TLSMD analysis.  TLSView is part of the Python Macromolecular Library (mmLib), and is specifically designed to be a interactive molecular viewer of the TLS groups generated by TLSMD.
</p>

You also get:
<ul>
<li> Various plots and graphical images showing the implied inter-domain or other motions.
<li> An animation of the implied motion via a
     <a href="http://jmol.sourceforge.net/"> Jmol</a>
     java applet
<li> Modified PDB files and TLS input files that can be used for further crystallographic
     refinement in the
     <a href="http://www.ccp4.ac.uk/">CCP4</a> program <b>Refmac5</b>
<li> These same files can be used for more detailed inspection in the
     <a href="http://pymmlib.sourceforge.net/">Python Macromolecular Library's</a> 
     <b>TLSView</b> interactive viewer, which offers a wide range of static
     and animated representations of the implied motions.
</ul>
</p>

<p><b><i>Note:</i></b>
This is a beta-test version of TLSMD. We expect it to change rapidly.
Please report any problems, suggestions, or blinding revelations inspired by the analysis.
If you publish an analysis based on the TLSMD results, please cite
<cite>Painter &amp; Merritt (2005) Acta Cryst. D61, 465-471.</cite></p>

<center><h3>Structure Submission</h3></center>
<!-- BLOCK: SUBMIT1 -->
<p><font size=+1><b>User Information</b></font><br>
Fill out the information submission form to complete the submission of your structure to
the TLSMD server.  If you would like to password protect your submission, then make sure to
fill out the <b>user</b> and <b>password</b> fields, otherwise your submission
will be publicly accessible.  Entering your email address is optional, we use it
only as a contact address if there is a problem with processing your submission.</p>

<p><font size=+1><b>Processing Time</b></font><br>
TLSMD runs a independent analysis on each protein chain present in your input
PDB file.  The time required to analyze each chain is roughly proportional to the
square of the number of residues in the chain, and the total analysis time for
your structure is the sum of the time taken for each chain.
On the current TLSMD server, a single 300 residue protein chain takes about 2 hours to analyze;
a homo-trimer with three 300 residue chains would take 2+2+2=6 hours.  For this reason, we
ask users submitting structures with protein chains larger than 600 residues
to use the <b>Include Atoms: Mainchain Only</b> option on the submission form
below to decrease the analysis time required for your protein.</p>

<p><font size=+1><b>Canceling Your Submitted Job</b></font><br>
If there is a problem with your submission, you may edit or kill the
submission through the <a href="webtlsmd.cgi?page=edit">Edit Job</a> web page on the TLSMD web site. Once submitted, you may monitor its status on the 
<a href="webtlsmd.cgi?page=queue">Job Queue</a> page, 
and once it is complete it will be moved into the 
<a href="webtlsmd.cgi?page=completed">Completed Jobs</a>
page.  These web pages are accessible from the navigation bar on all
TLSMD site web pages.</p>

<p><font size=+1><b>Submission Options</b></font><br>
There are three options controlling the minimization of your structure:
TLS Model, Least Squares Weighting, and Include Atoms.</p>

<p><b><i>TLS Model</i></b><br>
The TLS Model option selects either the isotropic form of the TLS equations,
or the anisotropic form.  If your structure has been refined with either
isotropic atomic displacement parameters (ADPs)(the parameter formerly known
as temperature factor), or TLS refinement, then select the isotropic
model. This is the default.  If you are lucky enough to have 1.0 Angstrom data
and used anisotropic ADPs refinement and you have ANISOU records in your PDB
file, then select the anisotropic TLS model.</p>

<p><b><i>Least Squares Weighting</i></b><br>
The TLS model parameters are fit to the individual atomic ADPs of your input model
using a over-determined system of linear equations.  In this system of equations,
each atom can be given an individual weight.  Ideally, this weight is the inverse of
the standard deviation of the parameter (in this case the standard deviation of
the atomic ADP in your input model). However, the standard deviations of the
ADPs are usually not known.  It is reasonable to approximate the ADP errors as being
inversely proportional to their <var>B<sub>Io</sub></var> values, so this is an
optional least squares weighting choice for the atom in TLSMD.</p>

<p><b><i>Include Atoms</i></b><br>
This option controls the subset of atoms used when fitting the TLS model
to your refined structure.  If you have chains with more than 600 residues,
then please only use the main chain atoms, otherwise your job could take
a long time to run.</p>
