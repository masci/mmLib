<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
The TLSView molecular viewer specializes in the visualization of TLS rigid body displacements of macromolecular structures.  It uses OpenGL for interactive graphics rendering, and supports most of the visualization found it other programs.  It also introduces a new screw-displacement traced surface, and computer animation of conventional visualizations according to rigid body displacement parameters.  The TLS model is a more complex than a simple Euclidean rigid body displacement, and a cursory understanding of the theory behind the TLS model is required to understand the visualizations available in TLSView.  For those in a hurry, it may be enough to know that the standard interpretation of the displacements parameterized in a TLS model can be reduced to six Euclidean displacements: 3 orthogonal translational displacements, and three screw displacements about non-intersecting orthogonal axes.  This is the canonical interpretation of TLS displacement, and it is used by TLSView to animate the displacement of the atoms in a TLS group.

<h3>Translation, Libration, Skew (TLS) Model Overview</h3>

<p>
Here are links to well-written introductions of Chasles' Theorem, tensors, and the multivariate Gaussian distribution.  They are subjects used in the formulation of the TLS model.

</ul>

<p>
In Euclidean space, a rigid body undergoing displacement is fully described by a 3x3 rotation matrix <var>R</var> and a 3x1 translation vector <var>t</var>.  The displacement can be simplified further and described by a simple screw displacement(see Chasles' Theorem): a rotation about a 3x1 vector up to given rotational magnitude while being translated along the vector by a magnitude proportional to the rotation(screw pitch).  Keep in mind the screw displacement takes a rigid body from one orientation to another, but the literal screw displacement path may not be the path followed by rigid body to get to the second orientation.  Even with this caveat the screw displacement is a useful concept when visualizing the rigid body displacement of a structure in a macromolecular viewer, because the magnitude of the displacements are small compared to the size of the rigid body.
</p>

<p>
Individual anisotropic ADPs give the mean square deviation(MSD) of a atom from its mean position as measured over time and crystal lattice position during a xray experiment.  The TLS rigid body model predicts the anisotropic ADPs for atoms based on their vector position relative the the TLS tensor origin.  The TLS model does this assuming the atoms are all points on a rigid body undergoing displacement.  This is not a Euclidean rigid body displacement, because ADPs are the MSD magnitudes of the atom's position within a Gaussian probablility distribution. The re-formulation of the Euclidean rigid body displacement to predict anisotropic ADPs results in a more complex description of rigid body motion requiring 20 unique parameters arranged into three 3x3 tensors: <var>T</var>, <var>L</var>, and <var>S</var>.  The <var>T</var> tensor, or translation tensor, is a symmetric 3x3 tensor(six unique parameters) with elements given in units of Angstroms<sup class=exponent>2</sup> just like the individual atomic anisotropic displacement tensor <var>U</var>.  The <var>T</var> tensor is the anisotropic translational displacement common to all atoms in the rigid body group.  The <var>L</var>, or libration(rotation) tensor, is also a symmetric 3x3 tensor with elements in units of Radians<sup class=exponent>2</sup>, but commonly converted to Degrees<sup class=exponent>2</sup> when reported.  The libration tensor describes rotational component of the rigid body displacement.  The <var>T</var> and <var>L</var> tensors can also be thought of as Gaussian variance-covariance tensors, which makes intuitive sense since the anisotropic ADP tensors <var>U<sup>TLS</sup></var> the TLS model predicts are also Gaussian variance-covariance tensors.  The <var>S</var> tensor is not usually symmetric, and isn't as easy to interpret directly like the <var>L</var> and <var>T</var> tensors.  It exists in the TLS model to account for a rotation-translation correlation which occurs when a rigid body undergoes rotation about three orthogonal rotation axes which do not intersect at a common point.
</p>

<p>
Given the TLS tensors and their origin, a TLS predicted anisotropic ADP may be calculated for any atom using its position relative to the TLS origin by the set of linear equations given in <b>Table 1</b>.

These equations can also be used to fit TLS tensors to the experimental individual ADPs of a group of atoms in a crystal structure.  This requires at least 6 atoms with anisotropic ADPs, or 21 atoms with isotropic ADPs.  Isotropic ADPs must be converted from their typical <var>B</var> values to equivalent <var>U<sup>ISO</sup></var> tensors.  Fitting a group of residues in a macromolecule often involves enough atoms so that the TLS parameters are overdetermined.  When this is the case, the TLS calculated <var>U<sup>TLS</sup></var> tensors can be compared with the experimental <var>U</var> tensors to quantify how well the model fit.  TLSView reports two ADP comparison functions: <b>R</b>, and <b>dP<sup>2</sup></b>.  
</p>

<p>
<var>U</var>, <var>T</var>, and <var>L</var> are all trivariate Gaussian variance-covariance tensors.  Since they are symmetric, each has six independent parameters.  Three parameters are the princpal MSDs along orthogonal axes, and three are the rotational orientation of the principal axes with respect to the current coordinate system.  When a tensor is rotated to its principal axes, the off-diagonal terms become zero and the principal axis MSDs can be read from the diagonal elements.  The orientation of the principal axes can be found by calculating the tensor eigenvectors.  Most programming routines for calculating eigenvectors return the normalized eigenvalue-eigenvector pairs.  The eigenvalue is the independent MSD in the direction of the eigenvector.  <b>Table 2</b> gives a overview of some useful properties common to all trivariate Gaussian variance-covariance tensors.

<p>
The reduction of a given TLS model to three translational displacements and three screw displacements is accomplished by a series of tensor transformations.  The parameters from the <var>L</var> and <var>S</var> tensor are combined to calculate the screw displacements, and the <var>T</var> tensor is reduced to a new translation tensor <var>T<sup>r</sup></var> which is a absolute minimum translational component for the TLS displacement.  Put another way, this reduction maximizes the displacement contribution from the screw axes while minimizing the displacment contribution from pure translation.  <b>Figure 2</b> demonstrates this type of reduction in two dimentions, where it is possible to completely eliminate the translational displacement.  This is accomplished by shifting the object rotation origin to a unique point where the rotation alone will complete the displacement.  Attempting this reduction on a displaced object in three dimentions leads to the result of Chastles' thereom, because a rotation about a axis displaces a object in the plane perpendicular to the rotation axis, and the remaining displacement is a translation perpendicular to the plane(parallel to the rotation axis).  For a TLS displacement, there is a unique tensor origin which minimized the trace of <var>T</var>, and also makes the <var>S</var> tensor symmetric.  This origin is called the <b>center of reaction</b>, <var>cor</var>.  The center of reaction is independent of the original tensor origin of calculation which is usually arbitrary.  Once the TLS tensor origin is shifted to the <var>cor</var>, the <var>L<sup>cor</sup></var> and <var>S<sup>cor</sup></var>
tensors can be used to calculate three perpendicular non-intersecting screw displacements which reduces the trace of <var>T<sup>cor</sup></var> further, resulting in a new  reduced translation tensor <var>T<sup>r</sup></var>.  <b>Table 3</b> gives a overview of all the the parameters involved in this reduction.

One option for visualizing a TLS model is to use the TLS calculated anisotropic ADPs to draw thermal ellipsoids or thermal axes.  Programs such as Raster3D and Ortep already do this.  The CCP4 project also has a program called TLSANL which will produce Molscript output to draw the non-intersecting screw axes as solid rods with a length proportional to the MSD rotational magnitude.  TLSView implements both of these visualizations with additional detail, and introduces two new visualizations for the screw displacements: a surface tracing the trajectory of the TLS group atoms, and oscillating computer animation of any of the supported visualizations.  These visualizations are shown in <b>Figure 3</b>.  The rotation of each screw displacement is calculated from the MSD and the trivariate Gaussian critical value table.  For the screw displacement surface visualization, the surface is drawn up to a displacement magnitude containing a percentage of the total distribution.  TLSView has one centeral control for selecting the isosurface probability magnitude so that all ellipsoids, surfaces, and animations will be drawn in proper proportions.
</p>

<p>
Atomic thermal ellipsoids may be drawn using a three different ADP tensors: <var>U</var> or <var>U<sup>iso</sup></var> from the structure file, <var>U<sup>tls</sup></var>, and <var>T<sup>r</sup></var>.  <b>Figure 1</b> shows a <var>U<sup>TLS</sup></var> and <var>T<sup>r</sup></var> ellipsoid for each atom.  The <var>U<sup>TLS</sup></var> ellipsoid has been set to be transparent, while 
<var>T<sup>r</sup></var> is opaque.  If the TLS model was fit to the experimental ADPs in the structure file, it may be interesting to render those ellipsoids too for a visual comparison of how well the TLS ADPs match the experimental ones.

Each tab window has its own Visualization Properties Dialog, and all the structures loaded in the tab window are arranged hierarchically by structure and chain in the left hand pane of the dialog.  The right hand pane displays panels containing settings for the currently selected visualization object, and any changes made to the visualization settings to not take effect until the <b>Apply</b> button has been depressed.  Most users familiar with molecular viewers will recognize the various options for visualizing structures, and most of the options work as expected.  Colors are selected through drop-down boxes which provide a menu of solid colors or color functions.  Depending on the object, the list of colors might be quite small, but the user can always enter a custom color using a floating point RGB triplet, separated by commas.  The range for each RGB value is between <b>0.0-1.0</b>.  When the selection <b>Random</b> is available in the menu, selecting it generates a single random RGB triplet which is displayed in the color selection entry box once applied.

The hierarchical arrangement of graphics objects allows parent objects to control the settings in their child objects.  This is the case for the <b>TLS Chain</b> object, which collects together the individual TLS groups defined in the chain.  Most options selected in the <b>TLS Chain</b> property panels are propagated to the <b>TLS Group</b> objects they contain, but properties of <b>TLS Group</b> objects can also be set individually.
