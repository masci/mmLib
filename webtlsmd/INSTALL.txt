Installing and Running TLSMD
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

INTRODUCTION::

The TLSMD program is a web-based application which analyzes the thermal parameters (temperature factors, also called atomic displacement parameters) of crystallographically determined protein structures.  A fully functional installation will require:

1) A appropriately configured web server capable of running Python CGI programs.  I use Apache.
2) A installation of Python 2.4.x with the following extensions: NumPy, the Berkeley Database Module bsddb, and the Python Imaging Library (PIL).  Future versions of TLSMD will require TurboGears.
3) The Python Macromolecular Library, pymmlib.
4) The daemon bin/webtlsmdd.py.  This is the web application daemon.
5) The daemon bin/webtlsmdrund.py.  This is the daemon which runs jobs submitted through the web interface.

TLSMD is written in a mixture of Python and C++.  The Python source is located in the bin/ and bin/tlsmdlib directories.  The C++ source is located in the src/ directory, and is compiled into a dynamically loaded Python extension called tlsmdmodule.  It is the computational core of TLSMD.


STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS::

[Install Python]
TLSMD requires Python 2.4 or greater.  It also requires several additional modules(Python extensions).  Each module should come with detailed installation instructions.  These modules are:
* NumPy (http://www.numpy.org)
* Python Imaging Library (http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/)
* Berkeley Database Module bsddb
	- this is a standard Python module, but may be packaged
	separately by some Linux distributions, or it may not be built
	if you are build Python from source and the configure script 
	cannot locate the appropriate libdb development headers
* Python Macromolecular Library (http://pymmlib.sourceforge.net)
	- you will not need to build the optional OpenGL accelerator 
	module

[Build the LAPACK Library]
The LAPACK library is available from http://www.netlib.org/lapack/.  LAPACK is a collection of linear algebra subroutines written in FORTRAN.  The makefiles shipped with LAPACK build the static libraries blas_LINUX.a and lapack_LINUX.a, both of which are linked with tlsmdmodule.

[Install MINPACK Library]
The MINPACK library is available from http://www.netlib.org/minpack/.  MINPACK contains a number for subroutines for solving systems on non-linear equations.  Like LAPACK, it is written in FORTRAN.  The com
